# School_District_Analysis

# 1. Overview of the school district analysis:

The point of the school district analysis is to determine the correlation between school performances and factors, such as budget, school size, and type of school. From this analysis, we can evaluate whether budgets are optimally allocated to enhance the overall school performance.   Later, we found out that the ninth-grade math and reading scores of the Thomas High Schools were compromised. Therefore, we re-analyze the data to see whether anything was different.
